*I am interested in the effects of spatial changes/urban regeneration on local 
*communities in terms of housing stability, happiness and economic status. 
*Urban development and policies regarding urban decay has encouraged urban planner and 
*government authorities to adopt policies that foster livability, economic growth
*as well as social and environmental capital. 
*Policy makers on the other hand have focused on public housing, affordable housing, 
*cultural led regeneration, eds and meds development which had sometimes happened through eminent domain.
*The outcome, however, is not always in favor of residents. 
*Some are displaced, segregated and end up in poor economic status.
*I wonder to what extend these spatial changes affect communities and what elements
*could help with sustaianble development. 
*
*
*
* Question: Spatial changes and their impacts on demographics/communities 
* now I am looking at demographics overtime, later will work on the development plans and find the correlation
* Time period: 2007, 2017
* Metrics: poverty rate, unemployent rate, household income rate, population estimate, migration rate, housing rental rate
