Research interest:
 Smart growth means reinvesting in America’s downtowns and Main Streets, the economic engines of big cities and small towns alike.
 Smart growth is creating homes for families of all income levels alongside one another, diversifying our transportation system so
Americans have a choice in how they get around, building streets that are safe for people walking, bicycling or using a wheelchair,
as well as driving, reimagining the places we have already built, and protecting our open green spaces for generations to come.
(Smart Growth America, 2019)
 Above all, smart growth is about helping every town and city become a more economically prosperous, socially equitable, and
 environmentally sustainable place to live. This approach looks different for every community, but can help neighborhoods of any
 kind flourish, make towns and cities competitive in a 21st century economy, and improve lives by improving neighborhoods.
(Smart Growth America, 2019)
 “"Smart Growth" (also referred to by its original title of growth management) is a local, regional, state and federal plans and legislation
that promote non-sprawl, compact, transit corridor or new town development patterns and require adequate public facilities to be
available at the time of development; "new urbanism" on the other hand  is focusing on transit oriented, traditional  neighborhood
and mixed use walkable communities” (Freilich & Popowitz, 2010, p-4). It’s re-purposing the place to tell the public that this is a 
different way to use an old infrastructure that’s still viable (NJpen, 2019). The idea of proximity is attracting more and more people
to a place to live and to work and to recreate there.

In my research I am trying to understand if there is affordable housing around condensed work places and whether there is walkability 
and integrated public transportation in both residential area and workplaces. This requires looking at households number, land use and 
the economic status of the residents which may guide authorities for better policies and development strategies shown by the following 
data at census tracks in Camden County.

Variables:
 diversity in the home choices based on income
 walkability
 transportation 
__________________________________________________________________

Research questions include the following:

1- Is smarth growth plan effective in Camden? Is there a noticebale improvement?
2- Has smarth growth helped with affordable housing and economic status?
3- Has there been any walkability/compact design happening in these years?

Indicators for the answers: 

1- Comparing 2007 and 2017 data in terms of
+ more population in urban areas that implies non sprawl development
       measured by principal cities, households and civil labor force   
+ more affordable housing/ home diversity for people
       meaured by studying the houshold numbers, poverty, income and employment status 
       and level of cost based on income 
	   also less vacanncy rate and more of occupancy 
+ more use of public transportation/ work at home because of tech advances 
       measured by the number of households, use of transportation and income 
+ compact development meaning that there is closer distantace between workplace and housing
  and more brownfield development 
       measured by 0.25mile distance or less that 5 mins time
	   measured by less vacancy and more occupancy 
+ how people are relying on cars, use public transportation and walk 
       measured by total trans based on civil labor and households and the diversity of 
	   the means comparing the two years 

2- 
+ Affordable housing means income housing that cost less that %30 of income 
+ Economic Status means if there are more jobs and employment, less poverty and less spenditure on transit 

3- 
+ less amount of time for commuting from home to work:  
* Walk Score's algorithm awards maximum points to amenities within 5 minutes' walk (.25 mi) * walk a quarter-mile to places around,
 and a decay function assigns points for amenities up to 30 minutes away.  https://www.walkscore.com/methodology.shtml

limitation: 
 Green space variable was hard to find in data sources and was hard to analyze in census track.
 It is recommened to be analyzed at neighborhood level.

/* 
Research questions include the following:

1- Is smarth growth plan effective in Camden? Is there a noticebale improvement?
2- Has smarth growth helped with affordable housing and economic status?
3- Has there been any walkability/compact design happening in these years?

Indicators for the answers: 

1- Comparing 2007 and 2017 data in terms of
+ more population in urban areas that implies non sprawl development
       measured by principal cities, households and civil labor force   
+ more affordable housing/ home diversity for people
       meaured by studying the houshold numbers, poverty, income and employment status 
       and level of cost on housing based on income 
+ more use of public transportation/ work at home because of tech advances 
       measured by the number of households, use of transportation and income 
+ compact development meaning that there is closer distantace between workplace and housing 
       measured by 0.25mile distance or less that 5 mins time 
+ how people are relying on cars, use public transportation and walk 
       measured by total trans based on civil labor and households and the diversity of 
	   the trans means comparing the two years 

2- 
+ Affordable housing means income housing that cost less that %30 of income 
+ Economic Status means if there are more jobs and employment, less poverty and less spenditure on transit 

3- 
+ less amount of time for commuting from home to work:  
* Walk Score's algorithm awards maximum points to amenities within 5 minutes' walk (.25 mi) * walk a quarter-mile to places around,
 and a decay function assigns points for amenities up to 30 minutes away.  https://www.walkscore.com/methodology.shtml
